"The Dead in the Classroom," by Stephen RushToanarlymorningfreshmaneconomicsclassofthirtylivestudents,
fifteen dead students were added.  Performance of both live and dead
students was observed through the course of the semester.  Data are
presented in the categories of:  attendance; behavior; participation; and
exam scores.  In three of the four areas, the dead students' performance
was the equal of, if not superior to, that of their living peers.
